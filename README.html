<h1>External Filter for Eclipse</h1>

http://www.mihai-nita.net/eclipse/
<p>This is a plugin that allows you to take text content from an Eclipse document, process it through an external tool,
and the make the result available in Eclipse at the end (see the <a href="#features">Features</a> section for complete info).<br />
The text is “feed” to the tool as standard input and the standard output becomes the result.</p>

<p>This is something I have missed for a while, and I am amazed that there is nothing out there already. Or maybe it is, and I could not find it...</p>
<p>So in a week-end or two I have put something together.
Some  of the inspiration cames from <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/gedit/">gedit</a>.</p>

<p>It should be able to run anything that you can normally execute on your machine (native applications, Perl/Python/shell scripts, Java, Groovy, etc.)</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>To install the plugin in Eclipse select Help -> Install New Software... and click “Add...” to add the following URL:<br/>
http://www.mihai-nita.net/eclipse</p>

<p>You can then select the site in the “Work with” list and continue the installation like with any other plugin.</p>

<a name="features"></a>
<h2>Features</h2>

<p>The input text can be the whole content of a document, or the current selection selection.
The result can be displayed in the Eclipse console, or a message box, in <span style="color: red">clipboard</span>,
can replace the current selection, or the whole document, can be appended to the document or at the insertion point,
or create a new document.</p>

<p>This is what I would like to add to it, although it should be usable already:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Specify the charset for the input / output (right now it is UTF-8, but there might bee tools that can't handle it)</li>
  <li>Allowing “replacement macros” in the command line (for things like document/project path, home folder, environment, Eclipse variables, prompt for input, etc.</li>
  <li>The ability to include a short script in the tool configuration itself (so that you don't need an external script)</li>
  <li>The ability to ask for a command to execute</li>
  <li>Specify how to deal with standard-error (merge with standard input, ignore, take it <b>instead</b> of standard input, etc.</li>
  <li>Handle nicely text from column selections.</li>
  <li>Whatever cool ideas you might sugest :-)</li>
</ul>
